### 2. Purpose and Mission

#### Mission Statement

The Workflows and Process Integration Working Group advances the Agentic AI Foundation’s mission by establishing a shared workflow model and common terminology for agentic AI systems, extending open specifications and projects, producing interoperability guidelines and design patterns that allow agent workflows to operate across frameworks, tools, and execution environments.

#### Why this Working Group exists

This Working Group was formed to address:

- How do we define common workflow primitives (tasks, tool calls, branching, handoffs) that work across agent frameworks and runtimes?
- How do we standardize the way agents coordinate with external systems, tools, and human reviewers within multi-step workflows?
- How do we ensure agent workflow definitions are portable across different frameworks and execution environments, avoiding vendor lock-in?
- How do we enable adoption of agent workflows that require stateful replayability and reliable failure recovery?
- How do we establish production-ready operational patterns for running agent workflows at scale?

#### Alignment to Foundation Goals

The work of this WG supports:

- Support the primary imperative that agentic AI requires complex, multi-step interaction by defining how workflows and agents orchestrate each other, including existing systems and human reviewers across organizational boundaries.
- Lower enterprise adoption barriers by establishing common patterns and terminology for workflow execution, failure recovery, human-in-the-loop coordination, and production operations.
- Advance agentic AI technologies by producing vendor-neutral workflow specifications and reference architectures that enable interoperability across frameworks and execution environments.

### 3. Scope

#### In Scope

**A. Agent Workflow Models and Semantics**
- Common terminology and primitives for agent workflows (tasks, tool calls, branching, sub-agents, retries etc.)
- Standard representation of agent workflow structures across frameworks
- Execution semantics for agent workflows (step ordering, parallelism, conditional paths)
- Agent handoff semantics between agents and sub-agents
- *Motivation:* Industry adoption challenges across agent frameworks due to misalignment on key definitions and lack of knowledge in translating deterministic workflow models to non-deterministic models used by autonomous agents

**B. Long-Running and Stateful Agent Execution**
- Patterns for workflows that run for minutes, hours, or days
- Handling partial completion and resuming interrupted agent workflows
- Workflow state persistence models
- Handling retries, idempotency, and failure recovery in agent workflows
- Workflow-level audit logs and systems of record (execution history, step outcomes, decision points) — distinct from runtime observability signals such as traces and metrics, which are handled by the Observability Working Group
- *Motivation:* Enterprise adoption challenges with long-running AI agents that are sensitive to data loss. Lack of controls and systems to deal with interruptions in agent workflows that can cause loss of state, context and progress

**C. Tool Invocation and External System Coordination**
- Standard workflow patterns for agent interaction with external systems
- Workflow coordination between agents and tools (APIs, CLIs, services)
- Handling multi-step tool execution within workflows
- Consistency patterns when agent workflows interact with external stateful systems
- *Motivation:* Enterprise workflow orchestration challenges related to connecting multiple workflows into a single, coherent execution model that can be governed centrally and run reliably

**D. Human-in-the-Loop Workflow Patterns**
- Workflow patterns for human approvals and interventions
- Interruptible workflows that pause for human review
- Escalation and fallback workflows when agent execution cannot proceed autonomously
- Design patterns for combining autonomous and human-driven steps
- *Motivation:* Enterprise agent adoption requirements for gatekeeping agentic operations with human review and approvals

**E. Workflow Portability and Interoperability**
- Portable workflow descriptions across agent runtimes
- Workflow interchange formats
- Agent handoff between different frameworks or execution environments
- Compatibility guidelines for workflow portability
- *Motivation:* Enterprise environments will use multiple frameworks and need a standard way to communicate and share state across multiple technology stacks

**F. Operational Patterns for Production Agent Workflows**
- Reference architectures for running agent workflows in production systems
- Failure handling patterns and workflow lifecycle management
- Best practices for operating and scaling differnet agentic workflows (deterministic, probablistic, etc.)
- *Motivation:* Enable platform and infrastructure teams to run workflows at their desired scale and understand how to create reusable patterns for workflow deployments across the organization
  
#### Out of Scope (what the WG will not do)

- Model training, LLM architecture, and model development are outside the scope of this working group.
- Prompt engineering methodologies and prompt optimization techniques are deferred to other technical groups.
- Security, privacy, and attack surface analysis are handled by the Security Working Group.
- Observability, tracing, debugging, and telemetry for agent systems are handled by the Observability Working Group.
- Ethics, governance frameworks, and regulatory considerations belong to the Governance & Risk Working Group.
- Evaluation of model reasoning quality and accuracy belongs to the Accuracy and Reliability Working Group.

#### Assumptions and Dependencies

- **Assumptions:** Agent frameworks and runtimes will continue to evolve independently; this WG produces standards and patterns that layer on top of existing execution environments rather than replacing them.
- **Dependencies:** This WG has interactions with the Reliability & Accuracy Working Group (reliability expectations of agentic workflows), the Observability Working Group (tracing and telemetry for workflow runs), and the Identity & Trust Working Group (agent identity and delegation within workflows).

### 4. Goals, Deliverables, and Success Criteria

#### 3-Month Goals
